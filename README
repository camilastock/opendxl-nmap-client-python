OpenDXL Python Nmap Client Library
=====================================

Overview
--------

The OpenDXL Nmap Client provides a high level wrapper for invoking the [Nmap tool](https://nmap.org)
via [Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx) (DXL) fabric.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to invoke Nmap commands (choosing the corresponding nmap's arguments) without having to focus
on lower-level details such as Nmap-specific DXL topics and message formats.

This client requires the OpenDXL Nmap Service to be running and available on the DXL fabric.

A Python-based implementation of an Nmap DXL service is available here:
